# Advent of Code

[AoC](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event leading up to Christmas created by [@topac](https://github.com/topaz) where one solves problems to earn stars.

AoC has been my first projects with Python & JS. A great way to learn! Here are my solutions.

## 2020

> 29 (WIP) ⭐

First-year, and first time using Python. Was eight days in when I learned a bit more of how everything worked. Went back and refactored all the code then continued Day 8 on.

I found Day 10 _especially_ difficult, spending an entire day to finally come up with a decent solution. Not currently stuck but yet to have the time to continue going with Day 15.

## 2019

> 4 (WIP) ⭐

Second-year, first time using JavaScript. Not too much trouble yet. However, I did get stuck and spend way too much time on Day 2 #2 in which turned out to be a bug caused by copying lists!
